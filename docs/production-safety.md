# Production safety changes in 1.2.1

This release addresses the five findings in the review of main commit `66786088c3988478afe34518d779694b00d882b1`. Automated tests do not constitute staging approval. Deploy first with disposable accounts and balances on the exact production plugin stack.

## Ownership and payment

Shipping removes cargo from its GUI slot and marks the player as sending **before** invoking any payment provider. Reentrant confirmations are rejected. If a synchronous currency listener closes the menu, changes eligibility or brings the recipient online, the send is cancelled and its reserved cargo and successful payment are compensated once. A rejected payment restores cargo to the still-owned empty slot or returns it to the current player if the menu has closed.

Database rejection, including queue admission failure, follows the existing cargo and original-provider fee refund path. A failed provider refund is reported for administrator reconciliation. An exception from a provider does not prove whether funds were debited; do not manually refund until that account's transaction history is checked.

## Recovery and migration

Initialization adds `claim_generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` without modifying existing payloads. Claims compare their observed generation and status. Restoring an undelivered claim atomically advances the generation and restores the original expiration timestamp. A stale snapshot cannot reserve or restore a later attempt.

The delivery worker stores known-undelivered compensation in `delivery-receipts/undelivered/<id>-<generation>.restore`, forces its content to disk, then attempts SQLite restoration. Database failures are retried every five seconds and during graceful shutdown. Receipts replay after restart. An old receipt left behind after successful restoration cannot affect a newer generation.

Delivered `.ack` files retain their separate meaning: they release reservations and never return items. Unknown pending claims are not automatically restored. Invalid or conflicting recovery metadata is retained and logged for inspection. If the receipt filesystem itself is unwritable, the worker retains the intent in memory and retries; a process crash before that intent reaches disk remains uncertain.

Before upgrading, stop the server and back up **the entire plugin data folder**, including receipts, plus player inventories and currency data. Keep the backup as one recovery set. Do not downgrade to 1.2.0 against the migrated live database: old code does not enforce generation guards. Restore a coordinated backup if rollback is necessary.

## Resource budgets

Existing configuration files receive these defaults through code; new installations also show the settings in `config.yml`.

| Setting | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mail.max-package-payload-bytes` | 262144 | Reject new oversized packages before payment; valid range 1024–1048576 |
| `database.max-queued-operations` | 256 | Bound queued SQLite work; rejected submissions complete exceptionally instead of disappearing |
| `mail.max-completions-per-tick` | 64 | Limit completion callbacks started in one tick |
| `mail.completion-budget-ms` | 2 | Stop starting callbacks after the tick budget is exhausted |

Container scanning also has a fixed 8192-step traversal budget, in addition to the configured nesting limit. The callback time budget cannot preempt an individual third-party callback already running.

Mailbox and sent-history page queries omit all payload BLOBs. Package icons are lightweight chest summaries rather than containers carrying full nested item metadata. Books and packages are fetched individually when selected. Oversized legacy cargo remains stored, but normal claiming refuses to decode it above the configured limit; contact an administrator to arrange controlled recovery. Viewing sent history never transfers items or changes recipient unread state.

Navigation retains one active query per player and the latest requested view. A scheduler tick starts that view once the previous query completes. Closing a menu discards its pending navigation. Shutdown drains accepted writes and callbacks before closing SQLite; do not force-kill a server that is still completing compensation.

SQLite JDBC is upgraded to **3.51.3.0**, including the WAL-reset corruption fix. Sources: [SQLite WAL advisory](https://sqlite.org/wal.html), [Xerial release](https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases/tag/3.51.3.0). Keep the database on a local filesystem and avoid concurrent writable maintenance while the server is running.

## Administrator reconciliation

For claims already stranded by an older release, an absent receipt means the plugin cannot determine whether items were delivered. Do not bulk-reset `delivery_pending` or all claimed rows.

1. Stop the server, retain a coordinated backup, and record the mail ID, recipient UUID, generation, status and existing receipt files in an incident record. Inspect the recipient's inventory and currency/server logs to establish whether delivery occurred.
2. If delivery is proven, an administrator can clear only that matching claimed row's pending flag without changing its status or payload. If non-delivery is proven, restore only that matching row to `UNCLAIMED` or `RETURNED` as appropriate, clear its pending flag, and increment `claim_generation` in the same SQLite transaction. Do not perform either operation while the outcome is uncertain.
3. Record the operator, evidence, chosen outcome, exact before/after row and timestamp in the incident record. Archive any superseded receipt with that record before restarting. Check that subsequent receipt replay and another claim do not repeat delivery.

Use a copy of the backup to rehearse reconciliation before touching the stopped server's data. This procedure does not infer missing delivery evidence and is not an automatic repair for ambiguous claims.

## Required staging acceptance

### Payment reconciliation evidence

Nonzero Vault currency withdrawals first force a small, uniquely identified intent into `payment-reconciliation/*.pending`. If that write fails, the provider is not called. A returned provider result removes the intent; an exception leaves it and reports its reference to the player. No automatic refund is issued for an unknown debit. Include this directory in coordinated backups.

An intent is not proof that a debit occurred: a crash can happen before the call, or cleanup can fail after a successful response. Compare the account UUID, amount, timestamp and reference with provider records, mail history and server logs. Record the outcome and any manual correction, then archive the intent. Never refund every pending intent in bulk. Partial intent files also require inspection.

The intent write is synchronous immediately before the synchronous Vault call so currency cannot change before evidence is durable. Measure its latency with the actual staging storage. Graceful shutdown drains accepted database work and callbacks; storage faults can delay stopping. Interrupting this drain can leave cross-store outcomes uncertain and requires reconciliation.

### Test cases

Record the exact Paper/Java, Vault, EnthusiaCurrency, CombatLogX (and its required libraries), Nexo and listener-plugin versions. Use the real Nexo resource pack and configured icons; keep staging balances and inventory disposable.

- Send using bank-only, physical-only and combined currency balances. Verify the quote precedes withdrawal and the successful fee is charged once. Reject insufficient balance without taking cargo.
- Exercise a currency withdrawal listener that closes/replaces the menu. Confirm no outgoing package is inserted and that cargo and any successful fee are returned once. Repeat with a rejected payment and with combat or disconnect during payment.
- Make a test provider debit and then throw. Confirm returned cargo, no automatic refund or outgoing package, and a retained payment intent. Make the intent directory unwritable and verify no provider call occurs. Inspect successful-payment cleanup and force-write latency.
- Claim while disconnecting, losing permission, entering combat or filling inventory. Hold a database write lock longer than the busy timeout, release it, restart, then confirm one claimable package and one final inventory delivery.
- Verify delivered and undelivered receipts separately. Replay a stale restoration receipt after a newer claim and confirm it does not reopen the package. Test malformed receipts and disk-full/read-only conditions on disposable data.
- Restart with a complete temporary undelivered receipt and verify it is promoted before recovery. Keep truncated temporary receipts held for administrator inspection.
- Navigate rapidly through inbox and sent categories during slow storage. Confirm cursor placement, selected-category labels, receipt recovery, and other players' sends remain usable.
- Test Nexo enabled, disabled, unavailable and not-yet-loaded items. Check title glyphs, fallback icons, click controls, package placement markers, overflow and sounds on a real client.
- Stop cleanly during pending sends and claims, then restart. Rehearse coordinated backup/restore and explicitly assess abrupt-stop uncertainty. Inventory, third-party currency and SQLite do not share an atomic transaction.

Claimed package data remains retained for history and incident recovery; monitor database size and define a deliberate retention policy. Chat filtering remains outside this change as requested.

## Failed-shipment recovery

Retain and back up `plugins/EnthusiaExpress/shipping-recovery` with `mail.db`, player data and currency data. Before cargo or postage moves, Express forces a properties record containing the sender, recipient, item serialization (Base64 `cargo`), original postage route, cost and timestamp. Failure to create this record refuses the shipment before charging. Atomic file replacement must be supported by the plugin data filesystem.

After SQLite rejects a shipment, its record becomes `PENDING`. Every five seconds, at most 16 records are considered in rotating order. Recovery waits for the sender to be online, an empty cargo slot and an owned currency movement lease. It uses the original receipt during the same plugin lifetime and reconstructs the recorded physical Raw Gold or EnthusiaCurrency/Vault refund route after restart. Changing payment configuration cannot redirect a pending refund. Offline recovery waits for the next join; no stale offline Player inventory is written.

Before returning assets, Express forces `APPLYING`. It saves player data after compensation and writes `COMPLETE` before deleting the record. A failed/partial inventory mutation, refused/uncertain provider refund or interrupted save leaves `APPLYING` for operator reconciliation; it is never automatically retried. `PREPARED` likewise cannot be replayed automatically because payment or shipment acceptance may have occurred. Neither phase alone proves that a refund is owed. Inspect the matching mail rows, account history, player inventory and record before manually restoring cargo or crediting the recorded postage. Archive reconciled records outside the live recovery folder. Do not change an uncertain phase to `PENDING` to force a retry. Malformed records are retained and logged; `.tmp` files are never automatic refund instructions.

This closes the lost-lease shutdown window. It does not make Minecraft inventory, dropped items, SQLite and an external currency provider one crash-atomic transaction. Abrupt-stop outcomes can still require the manual reconciliation described above. Staging must exercise lock expiry/contention, disconnect/rejoin, graceful restart, full inventory, provider refusal/exception, and interruption during `APPLYING`, with the real EnthusiaCurrency, EnthusiaStaff, CombatLogX and Nexo setup. Measure synchronous force-write latency with representative package sizes.
